# CNET-WORLD-CLIMATE-ANALYSIS
This dashboard provides an analytical overview of global climate conditions for the year 2015. It covers multiple environmental metrics including temperature, pressure, air quality, geographical coordinates, and celestial events (sunrise/sunset) across various countries. 
Objective
This dashboard provides an analytical overview of global climate conditions for the year 2015. It covers multiple environmental metrics including temperature, pressure, air quality, geographical coordinates, and celestial events (sunrise/sunset) across various countries. The aim is to help environmental analysts, climate scientists, and policymakers identify trends and extremes in global climate data.

Key Metrics and Insights
Country by Latitude:

Lesotho has the highest latitude value (265.1), indicating its extreme position in the dataset.

Other top entries include Andorra, Australia, and Kazakhstan.

Country by Longitude:

Tuvalu leads with the highest longitude (179.2), followed by Fiji Islands, New Zealand, and Marshall Islands.

The data reflects countries located across the Pacific and other eastern longitudes.

Country by Temperature:

Kuwait registered the highest average temperature (35.0°C) in 2015.

Other hot nations include Qatar (34.1°C), Bahrain (34.0°C), UAE (33.4°C), and Djibouti (33.3°C).

Air Quality Indicators:

Ozone: Saudi Arabia recorded the highest ozone reading (85.7).

Nitrogen: Iran topped nitrogen dioxide levels (101.7).

Sulphur Dioxide: Iran again led with the highest sulphur dioxide (62.2).

Comparative bar charts show pollutant averages across Iran, Venezuela, China, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia.

Pressure Data:

Namibia showed the highest pressure (30.3), followed closely by Mexico, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

A donut chart breaks down the distribution of pressure values among these nations.

Lowest Celsius Readings:

Lesotho again leads with the lowest celsius reading (265.1), followed by Andorra, Australia, and Kazakhstan.

This highlights the coldest geographical zones recorded in 2015.

Sunrise & Sunset Data (5 Countries):

Spain has the latest average sunset time (0.9), with other countries such as Netherlands, France, Belgium, and Andorra following.

Metrics include average sunrise time, sunset time, and precipitation.

**Recommendations**
Monitor Air Pollution in Iran and Saudi Arabia: High nitrogen and sulphur dioxide levels demand environmental regulations.

Support Climate Resilience in Hot Regions: Countries like Kuwait and Djibouti should prioritize cooling infrastructure and water conservation.

Explore Geographic Extremes: Use the latitude and longitude data to understand the correlation between location and climatic conditions.

Improve Climate Reporting from Small Nations: Low-represented nations (e.g., Tuvalu, Micronesia) might require better data infrastructures.

Use Seasonal Averages: Including data per quarter would enhance insights into climate variation throughout the year.
